# Explainability in AI

### 1. Conceptual Definitions of Explainability

#### 1.1 Foundational Level

**What is Explainability?**  
Explainability means helping people understand **why and how** an AI or computer system makes a decision or prediction. Just like a teacher explaining how they arrived at a grade, an AI should be able to say, “I decided this because…” in a way that makes sense to us.  

**Key Points:**  
- It’s about **clarity**: people want to see the steps or reasons behind an outcome.  
- It’s about **trust**: when you know why something happened, you’re more likely to trust it.  

---

#### 1.2 Intermediate Level

**Explainability Essentials**  
Explainability refers to the methods and techniques that enable humans to see **inside** an AI system’s reasoning process. Imagine a black box where inputs (like a person’s information) go in, and an AI outputs a decision (like approving or denying a loan). Explainability is what helps us **peek inside** that box to understand the key factors that led to the decision.

**Key Points:**  
- Often tied to **ethical and legal requirements** (e.g., ensuring fairness).  
- Involves methods that **translate** complex AI logic into **human-comprehensible** explanations.  

---

#### 1.3 Advanced Level

**Explainability in a Technical Context**  
Explainability in AI involves creating methodologies that map a high-dimensional, complex model (like a deep neural network) onto interpretable human concepts. This includes:  

1. **Feature Attribution** – Assessing how much each input feature contributed to the output.  
2. **Surrogate Modeling** – Building a simpler model that approximates the complex model’s behavior to provide explanations.  
3. **Visualization** – Using techniques like heatmaps (e.g., Grad-CAM) to show what parts of an image influenced a neural network’s classification.

Explainability seeks to ensure stakeholders (developers, regulators, end-users) can **audit** and **understand** AI decisions, thereby facilitating **trust**, **accountability**, and **compliance** with regulations.

---

#### 1.4 Professional Level

**Explainability, Interpretability, and Accountability**  
At a professional level, Explainability is more than a set of algorithms; it is a fundamental part of **risk management** and **governance** in AI systems. It is often distinguished from Interpretability:  

- **Interpretability** may refer to how **inherently understandable** a model is (e.g., a linear regression vs. a deep network).  
- **Explainability** can include **post-hoc** techniques that attempt to clarify decisions made by inherently complex models.  

Professionals implementing Explainability solutions consider:  
- **Regulatory compliance** (e.g., GDPR in the EU).  
- **Ethical obligations** to ensure users are informed.  
- **Technical trade-offs** between simpler, more explainable models and more accurate, less transparent models.

---

#### 1.5 Scholarly Level

**Explainability within the Research Landscape**  
Scholarly work on Explainability delves into formalizing the concept with metrics of **fidelity**, **stability**, **completeness**, and **fairness**. Researchers investigate the following:  

- **Formal Explanation Models**: For instance, designing an operator \( E \) that, given a model \( f \) and input \( x \), produces a structured explanation \( E(f, x) \).  
- **Complexity of Explanations**: Balancing **transparency** with the model’s computational or representational complexity.  
- **Causality and Counterfactuals**: Using **causal inference** to show how changing certain inputs would change the outcome.  
- **Human-Centric Evaluation**: Assessing how real people understand, use, and trust explanations.

Academic discourse also examines **sociotechnical** dimensions (e.g., user perspectives, legal norms, cultural contexts) that shape the demand for and design of explanations.

### 2. A Mathematical Definition of Explainability

Formally, consider a predictive model:

\[
f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y},
\]

where \(\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is the input space (e.g., features) and \(\mathcal{Y}\) is the output space (e.g., \(\mathbb{R}\), \(\{0,1\}\), or categorical labels).

An **explanation function** \( E \) can be seen as:

\[
E: \Bigl(\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \times ( \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}) \Bigr) \to \mathcal{Z},
\]

where \(\mathcal{Z}\) is a human-interpretable space (e.g., textual rules, feature attributions, or visual highlights). For a given input \(x \in \mathcal{X}\), predicted output \(f(x) \in \mathcal{Y}\), the explanation \(E(x, f(x), f)\) should satisfy certain properties:

1. **Fidelity**: The explanation is accurate in describing the model’s behavior.  
2. **Comprehensibility**: The explanation is understandable to the target audience.  
3. **Stability**: Small changes in \(x\) produce consistent changes in the explanation.  
4. **Actionability**: The explanation provides insights that can guide meaningful actions.

Hence, **Explainability** is the study and practice of constructing or approximating the function \(E\) such that humans can interpret and act upon the information provided.

---

### 3. Mathematical/Code Representation of an Explanation

A popular example is **feature attribution** via **Shapley values** (SHAP). Given a model \(f\), the Shapley value for feature \(i\) in an input \(x\) is computed by considering all subsets \(S\) of features that exclude \(i\), and taking:

\[
\phi_i(f, x) \;=\; \sum_{S \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\} \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!\,(n - |S| - 1)!}{n!}\;\bigl(f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S)\bigr),
\]

where \(f(S)\) is the model prediction when only features in \(S\) are present (and others are typically set to some baseline). This formula can be implemented in Python using the **SHAP** library:

```python
import shap

# model is a trained machine learning model (e.g., XGBoost, RandomForest, etc.)
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
shap_values = explainer(X_test)  # X_test is the data we want explanations for

# shap_values now contain the Shapley value explanations for each feature and instance
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
```

This produces **explanations** in terms of how much each feature influences the model’s output.

### 4. Real-World Example of Explainability

**Credit Scoring System**  
- Many banks use complex machine learning models to decide whether to grant loans.  
- **Explainability** helps both the bank and the customer understand **why** a particular decision (approve/deny) was made (e.g., credit history, income, existing debts).  
- **Attribution:** A real-world case is discussed in **European Commission guidelines on Automated Decision Making (European Commission, 2018)**, emphasizing the need for “meaningful information about the logic involved.”

In practice, the bank might use **SHAP** or **LIME** to highlight that “80% of this decision is based on your credit score, and 20% is based on your recent transaction history.” This fosters **trust** and ensures **regulatory compliance** under frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### 5. Quantitative Definition of Explainability (Seminal Example)

A widely-cited framework defines Explainability using **two key metrics**:

1. **Fidelity (\(\alpha\))**: A measure of how accurately the explanation function \(E\) represents the original model \(f\). Mathematically, one might define:

   \[
   \alpha(E, f, X) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{x \in X} \ell\bigl(E(x, f(x), f), f(x)\bigr)}{|X|},
   \]

   where \(\ell\) is some loss function measuring the difference between the predicted explanation’s behavior and the actual model output.

2. **Interpretability (\(\beta\))**: A measure of how easily humans can comprehend \(E\). One might assign a complexity measure (e.g., number of rules in a rule-based explanation). Lower complexity typically implies higher interpretability.

A “good” explanation aims to **maximize** \(\alpha\) (fidelity) while **minimizing** the complexity measure for \(\beta\), subject to the domain’s constraints and user’s expertise. A seminal example is **Ribeiro, Singh, & Guestrin (2016)** introducing **LIME** with fidelity and simplicity trade-offs for linear approximations.

### 6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. **What is the difference between Explainability and Interpretability?**  
   - **Interpretability** often refers to how transparent the model is by design (e.g., linear vs. deep models).  
   - **Explainability** can also include **post-hoc** methods providing insights into otherwise “black box” models.

2. **Do simpler models always mean better Explainability?**  
   - Not necessarily. Simpler models might be more **interpretable** but can still be opaque if they use too many features or if the relationships are non-linear. Complex models can sometimes be **explained** using post-hoc techniques.

3. **Is there a trade-off between accuracy and Explainability?**  
   - Often, yes. Highly accurate models like deep neural networks can be harder to explain, so there might be a trade-off. However, new research focuses on developing high-performing yet more explainable architectures.

4. **Why is Explainability important for ethical AI?**  
   - It ensures transparency, fairness, and accountability. Stakeholders can see **why** a system made a decision, identify potential biases, and correct them.

5. **Can explanations be misleading?**  
   - Yes, some post-hoc explanation methods can produce partial or “approximate” insights that do not fully reflect the model’s internal reasoning.
