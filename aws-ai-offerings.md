**Assignment: Exploring Ethical and Explainable AI with AWS**

---

### Overview and Goals

In this assignment, you will explore **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and its **Explainable AI** offerings, focusing on *ethical AI* and *responsible AI* capabilities. You will learn how AWS provides tools to detect bias, generate feature attributions, and incorporate human oversight into ML workflows. By completing this assignment, you will:

1. **Gain familiarity** with AWS’s approach to ethical and responsible AI, especially in Amazon SageMaker.  
2. **Demonstrate hands-on skills** in at least one AWS explainability feature or service.  
3. **Optionally** apply Jupyter-based ML explainability algorithms (e.g., **SHAP**, **LIME**, **Counterfactual Explanations**, **Integrated Gradients**, **Saliency Maps**, **PDP**, **ICE**, **Anchor Explanations**, **Permutation Feature Importance**, **Feature Ablation**, or **Surrogate Models**) from within AWS (e.g., in SageMaker Studio notebooks).

This assignment addresses real-world scenarios where AI models must be **explainable, fair, and compliant**. You will pick one or more AWS resources to showcase your mastery of ethical AI considerations.

### Part A: Understanding AWS Responsible AI

**Task**  
1. **Read** the AWS documentation (and other references) on “Responsible AI” and “Explainable AI.” In particular, look at:  
   - *SageMaker Clarify (Bias Detection & Explainability)*  
   - *SageMaker Model Monitor*  
   - *Augmented AI (A2I)* for human-in-the-loop review  
   - Any relevant “Privacy and Data Protection” or “Transparency and Accountability” sections from AWS

2. **Summarize** in a short report (1–2 pages) the key AWS services (or features within SageMaker) that address explainability and responsible AI. Highlight:  
   - How each service contributes to ethical AI practices  
   - Where it fits in the ML workflow (e.g., data preparation, inference, post-deployment monitoring)  
   - Potential biases or ethical pitfalls these tools can detect or mitigate

**Deliverables (Part A)**  
- A short PDF or Markdown summary (1–2 pages) titled *“AWS Responsible AI Landscape.”*

### Part B: Concrete Options for Hands-On Work

#### **Option 1: SageMaker Clarify on a Small Classification Model**

1. **Dataset and Model**  
   - Acquire or create a small dataset (e.g., credit scoring, HR retention, or social media sentiment).  
   - Train a classification model in SageMaker (using either **SageMaker Autopilot** or a custom training script in **SageMaker Studio**).  

2. **Clarify Analysis**  
   - Configure **SageMaker Clarify** pre-training analysis to check for potential dataset bias (e.g., distribution differences by gender/ethnicity/other protected attribute).  
   - Train your model, then run **post-training bias detection** to see if predicted outcomes are uneven across subgroups.  
   - Generate **Explainability** results (e.g., feature attributions) to understand which features most influenced predictions.

3. **Document**  
   - Present the Clarify output (bias metrics, feature attribution charts).  
   - Explain any steps taken to reduce bias (e.g., rebalancing data) or interpret how certain features shape model decisions.

---

#### **Option 2: Jupyter Notebook with a Custom Explainability Algorithm**

1. **Notebook Setup**  
   - In **SageMaker Studio**, create a Jupyter notebook. Install Python libraries for advanced interpretability (e.g., `pip install shap lime alibi`).

2. **Train a Model**  
   - Could be an XGBoost or PyTorch model on a simple dataset.  
   - Deploy to a SageMaker Endpoint for inference.

3. **Run an Explainability Method**  
   - Demonstrate **at least one** advanced approach from the list:
     - **SHAP** (Shapley additive explanations)  
     - **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)  
     - **Integrated Gradients**, **Saliency Maps** (if using a neural network)  
     - **PDP** (Partial Dependence Plot), **ICE** (Individual Conditional Expectation), etc.

4. **Visualize and Summarize**  
   - Show how the chosen method explains sample predictions.  
   - Discuss interpretability differences: does the method show consistent feature importance? Are there any surprising influences on predictions?

---

#### **Option 3: SageMaker Model Monitor for Drift + Explanation**

1. **Data Drift Setup**  
   - Train and deploy a model (e.g., classification for churn).  
   - Enable **Model Monitor** to capture incoming data in production (simulate real-time by replaying data or scheduling batch inputs).

2. **Detect Drift**  
   - Introduce a shift (e.g., artificially change distribution of certain features).  
   - Observe how Model Monitor detects drift over time.

3. **Explain Model Changes**  
   - Use Clarify or a notebook-based approach to see if predictions for certain subgroups degrade or shift in unexpected ways.

4. **Discussion**  
   - Propose steps to retrain or mitigate performance changes.

---

#### **Option 4: Human Review with Amazon A2I**

1. **Select a Use Case**  
   - E.g., Document classification with uncertain predictions or sensitive decisions requiring human sign-off.

2. **Setup A2I Flow**  
   - Configure a pipeline where predictions below a confidence threshold trigger a “human review task.”  
   - Validate or correct labels in the A2I console or via Mechanical Turk / internal workforce.

3. **Integration**  
   - Discuss how human review ensures fairness or correctness in borderline cases.  
   - Show final results stored, possibly re-fed into training for improved model accuracy.

### Part C: Deliverables and Rubric

**Overall Deliverables:**
1. **Short Summary** (Part A) about AWS’s responsible AI capabilities  
2. **Hands-on Demo** (Part B) choosing one of the options above (or propose a custom approach). Deliver:
   - Code (Jupyter notebooks or scripts) + instructions to replicate your steps
   - Explanation slides or a short write-up describing your process, findings, and reflections
3. **Discussion** of Results:
   - What biases or issues did you detect (if any)?  
   - How did you interpret the model’s decisions?  
   - How do these AWS services (Clarify, A2I, Model Monitor, etc.) aid ethical AI?

### Submission Notes

- You may work individually or in small teams (2-3).

- If you cannot access an AWS account, you can simulate partial steps locally but must demonstrate or show screenshots of the relevant AWS features (Clarify, Model Monitor, etc.).

**Expected Format:**  
- A GitHub repository (or zip folder) containing:
  - Jupyter notebooks / scripts
  - A short PDF report (including your Part A summary and Part B results)
  - Screenshots of AWS SageMaker or other service UIs showing your analysis
